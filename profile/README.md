## About the Repositories/Development of the Code 🤝

The repositories in this organization are a **collaborative effort** between two individuals, each contributing **equally to the development process**. While GitHub’s contributions graph may show uneven statistics at times, rest assured that both contributors share an approximate **50%** of the work. 👥⚖️
